# Multi-API-Wrapper

Multi-API-Wrapper was an experimental project aimed at creating a centralized wrapper around multiple third-party APIs commonly used in my Discord bots. These included APIs for image generation, random facts, jokes, and other fun content. The idea was to streamline how different APIs were called and handled by building a consistent and modular interface ‚Äî making the bot code cleaner and easier to maintain. Although the project wasn‚Äôt fully completed, it laid the foundation for better code organization across multiple bots.
